## üìò Project Descriptions  
   
   ### 1. UART Communication ‚Äì Printing ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù
     
   #### üîß To run a project:
   Navigate to the Hello_world project's folder `test` directory `Hello_world/test/` and Double-click on the corresponding `Hello_world.bat` file to program the FPGA.
  
   **NOTE:** Before running the batch file, make sure to update its path to match your Vivado installation directory. This is necessary for the batch file to run correctly.

   for ex: C:\Xilinx\Vitis\2024.1\bin\xsct.bat (this path should be edited inside the batch file to match your vivado installation directory)
 
   Before programming open the serial terminal of corresponding COM port with baudrate of 9600.
  
   #### üìù Description:
   This project serves as a basic sanity check to ensure the UART peripheral is functioning correctly and that the board can transmit data over a serial connection. It also helps familiarize users with integrating    IP cores and observing output through a terminal emulator like Tera Term or PuTTY.



  ### 2. Controlling Onboard Peripherals (LEDs and Seven Segment Display) with Slide Switches
     
  #### üîß To run a project:
  Navigate to the Peripheral_test project's folder `test` directory `Peripheral/test/` and Double-click on the corresponding `Peripheral_test.bat` file to program the FPGA.
  
  **NOTE:** Before running the batch file, make sure to update its path to match your Vivado installation directory. This is necessary for the batch file to run correctly.

  for ex: C:\Xilinx\Vitis\2024.1\bin\xsct.bat (this path should be edited inside the batch file to match your vivado installation directory)
 
  
  #### üìù Description:
  This project demonstrates how to interface and control key onboard peripherals LEDs and Seven Segment Display connectors-using the slide switches on the Elbert S7 FPGA board. It serves as a foundational         experiment to understand how input signals (from switches) can control output peripherals in an FPGA-based system.
  
  The design includes predefined behaviours:

   - When no switch is active, the seven-segment displays continuously count from 0 to 9 (same digit on all displays), while the LEDs perform a running light pattern.

   - When specific switches are turned ON, the system displays corresponding values:

    - Switch 1 (SW0): The seven-segment shows 3, and its binary representation (00000011) is shown on the LEDs.
  
    - Switch 2 (SW1): The seven-segment shows 5, and the LEDs display 00000101.
  
    - Switch 3 (SW2): The seven-segment shows 7, and the LEDs display 00000111.
  
This project is designed as a basic interface demo. You are encouraged to modify the functionality-such as changing the numbers shown on the seven-segment display, customizing LED patterns to suit your specific application needs or to experiment with your own designs. By completing this project, you‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with I/O interfacing, logic control based on inputs.
